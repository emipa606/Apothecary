[h1]Overview[/h1] V1.1

A medicinal mod focused on earlier technology epochs prior to the industrial age. (Also more suited to "fantasy" based mods).

[h1]Details[/h1]

Apothecary is a mod designed to provide herbal remedies and other medicinal preparations more suited to the Neolithic and Medieval epochs. It is designed as a preliminary mod prior to the use of Medical supplements which is more focused on the synthetic drug making process more associated with the industrial period and after.

As such it can be used as a standalone mod for inclusion in other mod elements that limit the time periods to earlier epochs for game play or where the mod theme may be more suited to those time periods.

The drugs are not quite as capable as the medical supplement mod versions, but still provide a capable solution with a broad spectrum of medicinal preparations for various illnesses and conditions prior to the industrial period.

Where both mods are being utilised, with MS drug versions superseding the apothecary versions with later research, the apothecary items can still be later utilised as a source of income as preferred.

Additional and more specific mod details can be found using the following link:

[h1]Mod notes[/h1]


Several research projects (in own tab, though not as expansive as MS). Recommend using mods that make the management of research projects more user friendly.

Mod option to use bandages more realistically (wont be present if Medical Supplements is loaded).

Mod option to vary the % base cost for all the research projects.

Can be loaded mid save, removal will require removing all game elements.
